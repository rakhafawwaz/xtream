        <p>In this game there are 5 main characters who fight for power, they have different strengths and have their own troops. When they began to struggle for power in an area they were brought together and no one knew when that time would occur depending on who was fast in fighting for another territory.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The struggle of the five of them did it in a way that only fought and some took sides and many others, of them 5 only have one goal and whether after their goals are achieved will it be better or worse?</p>
        <br>
        <p>In this game there are more than 5 different maps that tell the situation of each area that is contested and we can choose the characters themselves, and there is a feature if you have completed all missions for 1 vs 1 that can try all characters.</p>
